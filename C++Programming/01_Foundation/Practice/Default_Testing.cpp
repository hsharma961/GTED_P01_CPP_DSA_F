/*[7] Add a unit to each double entered; that is, enter values such as 10cm,
2.5in, 5ft, or 3.33m. Accept the four units: cm, m, in, ft. Assume
conversion factors 1m==100cm, 1in==2.54cm, 1ft==12in. Read the unit
indicator into a string. You may consider 12 m (with a space between
the number and the unit) equivalent to 12m (without a space).*/
